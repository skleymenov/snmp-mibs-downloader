 IETF TRUST  Legal Provisions Relating to IETF Documents
 Approved November 6, 2008
 Effective Date: November 10, 2008
 .
 1. Background
 .
 The IETF Trust was formed on December 15, 2005, for, among other things, the purpose
 of acquiring, holding, maintaining and licensing certain existing and future intellectual property
 used in connection with the Internet standards process and its administration, for the
 advancement of science and technology associated with the Internet and related technology.
 Accordingly, pursuant to RFC 5378, Contributors to the IETF Standards Process grant the IETF
 Trust certain licenses with respect to their IETF Contributions. In RFC 5377, the IETF
 Community has provided the IETF Trust with guidance regarding licenses that the IETF Trust
 should grant to others with respect to such IETF Contributions and IETF Documents. These
 Legal Provisions describe the rights and licenses that the IETF Trust grants to others with respect
 to such IETF Contributions and IETF Documents; as well as certain restrictions, limitations and
 notices relating to IETF Documents. Capitalized terms used in these Legal Provisions that are
 not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in RFC 5378.
 .
 2. Applicability of these Legal Provisions.
 .
 a. These Legal Provisions are effective as of November 10, 2008 (the “Effective Date”).
 .
 b. The licenses granted by the IETF Trust pursuant to these Legal Provisions apply
 only with respect to (i) IETF Contributions (including Internet-Drafts) that are submitted to the
 IETF following the Effective Date, and (ii) IETF RFCs and other IETF Documents that are
 published after the Effective Date.
 .
 c. IETF Contributions made, and IETF Documents published, prior to the Effective
 Date (“Pre-Existing IETF Documents”) remain subject to the licensing provisions of the IETF
 copyright policy document in effect at the time of their publication, including RFCs 1310, 1602,
 2026, 3978 and 4748.
 .
 d. In most cases, rights to Pre-Existing IETF Documents that are not expressly
 granted under these RFCs can only be obtained by requesting such rights directly from the
 document authors. The IETF Trust and the Internet Society do not become involved in making
 such requests to document authors.
 .
 e. These Legal Provisions may be amended from time to time by the IETF Trust in a
 manner consistent with the guidance provided by the IETF community and its own operating
 procedures. Any amendment to these Legal Provisions shall be posted for review at
 http://trustee.ietf.org/policyandprocedures.html and shall become effective on a date specified
 by the IETF Trust, but no earlier than thirty (30) days following its posting. Such amendment
 shall apply with respect to all IETF Contributions made and IETF Documents published
 following the effective date of such amendment. All prior versions of these Legal Provisions
 shall continue to be posted at http://trustee.ietf.org/policyandprocedures.html for reference with
 respect to IETF Contributions and IETF Documents as to which they may apply.
 .
 3. Licenses to IETF Documents and IETF Contributions.
 .
 a. License For Use Within the IETF Standards Process. The IETF Trust hereby
 grants to each participant in the IETF Standards Process, to the greatest extent that it is permitted
 to do so, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license under all copyrights and
 rights of authors:
 .
 i. to copy, publish, display and distribute IETF Contributions and IETF
 Documents, in whole or in part, as part of the IETF Standards Process, and
 .
 ii. to translate IETF Contributions and IETF Documents, in whole or part,
 into languages other than English as part of the IETF Standards Process, and
 .
 iii. unless explicitly disallowed in the notices contained in an IETF
 Contribution or IETF Document (as specified in Section 6.b below), to modify or prepare
 derivative works of such IETF Contributions or IETF Documents, in whole or in part, as part of
 the IETF Standards Process.
 .
 b. IETF Standards Process. The term IETF Standards Process has the meaning
 assigned to it in RFC 5378. In addition, the IETF Trust interprets the IETF Standards Process to
 include the archiving of IETF Documents in perpetuity for reference in support of IETF activities
 and the implementation of IETF standards and specifications.
 .
 c. Licenses For Use Outside the IETF Standards Process. In addition to the rights
 granted with respect to Code Components described in Section 4 below, the IETF Trust hereby
 grants to each person who wishes to exercise such rights, to the greatest extent that it is permitted
 to do so, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide right and license under all copyrights and
 rights of authors:
 .
 i. to copy, publish, display and distribute IETF Contributions and IETF
 Documents in full and without modification,
 .
 ii. to translate IETF Contributions and IETF Documents into languages other
 than English, and to copy, publish, display and distribute such translated IETF Contributions and
 IETF Documents in full and without modification,
 .
 iii. to copy, publish, display and distribute unmodified portions of IETF
 Contributions and IETF Documents and translations thereof, provided that:
 .
 (x) each such portion is clearly attributed to IETF and identifies the
 RFC or other IETF Document or IETF Contribution from which it is taken,
 .
 (y) all IETF legends, legal notices and indications of authorship
 contained in the original IETF RFC must also be included where any substantial portion of the
 text of an IETF RFC, and in any event where more than one-fifth of such text, is reproduced in a
 single document or series of related documents.
 .
 d. Licenses that are not Granted. The following licenses are not granted pursuant to
 these Legal Provisions:
 .
 i. any license to modify IETF Contributions or IETF Documents, or portions
 thereof (other than to make translations or to extract, use and modify Code Components as
 permitted under the licenses granted under Section 4 of these Legal Provisions) in any context
 outside the IETF Standards Process, or
 .
 ii. any license to publish, display or distribute IETF Contributions or IETF
 Documents, or portions thereof, without the required legends and notices described in these
 Legal Provisions.
 .
 e. Requesting Additional Rights. Anyone who wishes to request license rights from
 the IETF Trust in addition to those granted under these Legal Provisions may submit such
 request to trustees@ietf.org. Such request will be considered by the IETF Trust, which will
 make a decision regarding the request in its sole discretion and inform the requester of its
 disposition. In addition, individual Contributors may be contacted regarding licenses to their
 IETF Contributions. The IETF Trust does not limit the ability of IETF Contributors to license
 their Contributions, so long as those licenses do not affect the rights granted to the IETF Trust
 under RFC 5378.
 .
 4. License to Code Components.
 .
 a. Definition. IETF Contributions and IETF Documents often include components
 intended to be directly processed by a computer (“Code Components”). A list of common Code
 Components can be found at http://trustee.ietf.org/policyandprocedures.html .
 .
 b. Identification. Text in IETF Contributions and IETF Documents of the types
 identified in Section 4.a above shall constitute “Code Components”. In addition, any text found
 between the markers <CODE BEGINS> and <CODE ENDS>, or otherwise clearly labeled as a
 Code Component, shall be considered a “Code Component”.
 .
 c. License. In addition to the licenses granted under Section 3, Code Components
 are also licensed to each person who wishes to receive such a license on the terms of the "BSD
 License", as described below. If a licensee elects to apply the BSD License to a Code
 Component, then the additional licenses and restrictions set forth in Section 3 and elsewhere in
 these Legal Provisions shall not apply thereto.
 .

 .
 5. License Limitations.
 .
 a. No Patent License. The licenses granted under these Legal Provisions shall not be
 deemed to grant any right under any patent, patent application or similar intellectual property
 right.
 .
 b. Supersedure. The terms of any license granted under these Legal Provisions may
 be superseded by a written agreement between the IETF Trust and the licensee that specifically
 references and supersedes the relevant provisions of these Legal Provisions, except that (i) the
 IETF Trust shall in no event be authorized to grant rights with respect to any Contribution in
 excess of those which it has been granted by the Contributor, and (ii) the rights granted shall not
 be less than those otherwise granted under these Legal Provisions.
 .
 6. Text To Be Included in IETF Documents. The following text must be included on the
 first page of each IETF Document as specified below:
 .
 a. Submission Compliance for Internet-Drafts. In each Internet-Draft:
 This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and
 BCP 79.
 .
 b. Copyright and License Notice. In each IETF Document (including RFCs and
 Internet-Drafts):
 Copyright (c) [insert year] IETF Trust and the persons identified as the document authors. All
 rights reserved.
 This document is subject to BCP 78 and the IETF Trust’s Legal Provisions Relating to IETF
 Documents (http://trustee.ietf.org/license-info) in effect on the date of publication of this
 document. Please review these documents carefully, as they describe your rights and restrictions
 with respect to this document.
 .
 c. Derivative Works and Publication Limitations. If a Contributor desires to limit
 the right to make modifications and derivative works of an IETF Contribution, or to limit its
 publication, one of the following notices must be included. These notices may not be used with
 any standards-track document, nor with most working group documents.
 .
 i. If the Contributor does not wish to allow modifications, but does wish to
 allow publication as an RFC:
 This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not be created, except to
 format it for publication as an RFC and to translate it into languages other than English.
 .
 ii. If the Contributor does not wish to allow modifications nor to allow
 publication as an RFC:
 This document may not be modified, and derivative works of it may not be created, and it may not
 be published except as an Internet-Draft.
 .
 7. Terms Applicable to All IETF Documents. The following legal terms apply to all IETF
 Documents:
 .
 a. All IETF Documents and the information contained therein are provided on an
 "AS IS" basis and THE CONTRIBUTOR, THE ORGANIZATION HE/SHE REPRESENTS
 OR IS SPONSORED BY (IF ANY), THE INTERNET SOCIETY, THE IETF TRUST AND
 THE INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
 EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY THAT
 THE USE OF THE INFORMATION THEREIN WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY RIGHTS OR
 ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
 PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
 .
 b. The IETF Trust takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
 Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the implementation
 or use of the technology described in any IETF Document or the extent to which any license
 under such rights might or might not be available; nor does it represent that it has made any
 independent effort to identify any such rights.
 .
 c. Copies of Intellectual Property disclosures made to the IETF Secretariat and
 any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a
 general license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of
 this specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository at http://www.ietf.org/ipr.
 .
 d. The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any copyrights,
 patents or patent applications, or other proprietary rights that may cover technology that may be
 required to implement any standard or specification contained in an IETF Document. Please
 address the information to the IETF at ietf-ipr@ietf.org.
 .
 e. The definitive version of an IETF Document is that published by, or under the
 auspices of, the IETF. Versions of IETF Documents that are published by third parties,
 including those that are translated into other languages, should not be considered to be definitive
 versions of IETF Documents. The definitive version of these Legal Provisions is that published
 by, or under the auspices of, the IETF. Versions of these Legal Provisions that are published by
 third parties, including those that are translated into other languages, should not be considered to
 be definitive versions of these Legal Provisions.
 .
 f. For the avoidance of doubt, each Contributor to the IETF Standards Process
 licenses each Contribution that he or she makes as part of the IETF Standards Process to the
 IETF Trust pursuant to the provisions of RFC 5378. No language to the contrary, or terms,
 conditions or rights that differ from or are inconsistent with the rights and licenses granted under
 RFC 5378, shall have any effect and shall be null and void, whether published or posted by such
 Contributor, or included with or in such Contribution.
