snmp-mibs-downloader (1.1+nmu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload (with maintainer permission).
  * Switch to debhelper compatibility level 9.
  * Use canonical https URLs in Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser fields.
  * Remove executable bits from debian/control file.
  * Remove Section field from binary package stanza with same value as
    the one inherited from the source stanza.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.9.8.
  * Use .PHONY instead of .phony in debian/rules.
  * Automate maintainer update machinery for IANA and IETF MIB sources.
  * Compress all data sources instead of relying on dh_compress which
    on some conditions does not compress small files. (Closes: #595219)
  * Move IPFIX-SELECTOR-MIB from IANA to IANARFC lists. This MIB is provided
    by the RFC5815 but controlled by IANA, and is not available from the IANA
    web site (any more?).
  * Update IANA MIBs. (Closes: #689483)

snmp-mibs-downloader (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ship IANA resources directly rather than extracting them from the
    RFC. Not all resources are shipped as RFC and sometimes even the
    RFC listed in the history is plain wrong. (Closes: #574608)
  * Update policy to 3.8.4.
  * Add recently submitted RFCs to repository.
