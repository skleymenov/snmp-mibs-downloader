snmp-mibs-downloader (1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ship IANA resources directly rather than extracting them from the
    RFC. Not all resources are shipped as RFC and sometimes even the
    RFC listed in the history is plain wrong. (Closes: #574608)
  * Update policy to 3.8.4.
  * Add recently submitted RFCs to repository.
