Description: Downloads RFCs and IANA Docs containing MIBs and extracts them
 This package contains a script which downloads RFCs containing SNMP MIB
 files and extracts them into /usr/share/snmp/ietf. It also downloads the
 most current MIBs from IANA and extracts them into /usr/share/snmp/iana.
 .
 Strictly, the MIBs are not necessary for SNMP operations, but they contain
 names and descriptions for the SNMP OID tree.
